# Image2Contact

Image2Contact is the multimodal method proposed in the paper "Decoding Contact: Automatic Estimation of Contact Signatures in Parent-Infant Free Play Interactions".

Our unimodal approach can be reached via [Pose2Contact](https://github.com/dmetehan/Pose2Contact)

To annotate your own data with contact signatures you can use our annotation tool [HumanContactAnnotator](https://github.com/dmetehan/HumanContactAnnotator)
